    xml2db's `Document.parse_xml` loads a whole document tree into memory in one call. It has no
    way to flush partial results. Parsing one huge file directly risks running out of memory.

    This generator lets `process_xml_file_with_xml2db` parse a file in bounded-size pieces
    instead:

    - It streams the source with `lxml.etree.iterparse`.
    - For every `chunk_size` completed `child_tag` elements, it serializes a copy of the file's
      own root element, containing just that batch of children.

    Each fragment is a complete, well-formed XML document. xml2db can parse it exactly as if it
    were a smaller whole file: xml2db's data model keys elements by local name only, not by depth
    or namespace, so a `<root ...>{children}</root>` fragment parses the same as the equivalent
    slice of the original file. This includes the root-level table's own columns, copied from the
    fragment's root attributes.

    This assumes the shape described in the pipeline settings: one root element, directly
    followed by many repeated elements of a single type (`child_tag`). Any other top-level
    siblings stay attached to the source tree; they are not moved into a fragment, so this
    function does not bound their memory use. This is fine for schemas like UniRef, where `entry`
    is the only top-level child. A schema with several large, independently repeated top-level
    element types would need this function extended.

    Elements are moved, not copied, out of the source tree into each fragment. `Element.append`
    re-parents an element rather than duplicating it, so the source tree never holds more than a
    handful of already-processed elements at once. Overall memory use is governed by

    `settings.buffer_size` caps how many rows accumulate per table before a page is yielded; a file's

        automatically by `run_xml2db_ingest_pipeline` when `Xml2DbSettings.compact_reused_tables`
