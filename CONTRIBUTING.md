## Development Workflow

This repository requires Python >= 3.13 and is managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

1. Install dependencies (including development and documentation groups):
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```
2. Run lint and formatting checks with Ruff:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check
   ```
3. Run the local unit test suite (skipping container-only Spark and Ceph tests):
   ```bash
   uv run pytest -m "not requires_spark and not requires_ceph"
   ```
4. Regenerate and verify documentation artifacts if converter rules, CLI settings, or docstrings change:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m scripts.gen_converter_spec
   uv run python -m scripts.gen_docs
   ```

## GitHub Best Practices

### Creating and curating issues

    - Read ["About Issues"][about-issues]
    - Issues should be focused and actionable
    - Complex issues should be broken down into simpler issues where possible

### Pull Requests

    - Read ["About Pull Requests"][about-pulls]
    - Read ["About Branches"][about-branches]
    - Read [GitHub Pull Requests: 10 Tips to Know](https://blog.mergify.com/github-pull-requests-10-tips-to-know/)
    - Pull Requests (PRs) should be atomic and aim to close a single issue
    - Long running PRs should be avoided where possible
    - PRs should reference issues following standard conventions (e.g. “fixes #123”)
    - Never work on the main branch, always work on an issue/feature branch
    - Always create a PR on a branch to maximize transparency of what you are doing
    - PRs should be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion by the CDM science technical leads
    - PRs that do not pass GitHub actions should never be merged
    - In the case of git conflicts, the contributor should try and resolve the conflict
    - If a PR fails a GitHub action check, the contributor should try and resolve the issue in a timely fashion
